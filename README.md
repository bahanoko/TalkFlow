# TalkFlow

## Overview

TalkFlow visualizes the "topics" within conversations or text as a graph network, making the flow of discussion instantly clear.

### Possible Use Cases
- Joining a livestream midway and not understanding the conversation flow — use TalkFlow to catch up.
- Meetings where topics keep shifting — use TalkFlow to organize and track discussions.
- Reading a novel but forgot what happened earlier — use TalkFlow to recall previous topics.

- The graph reveals that the conversation developed starting from the topic "game."
- The most recently added nodes are displayed in red.
